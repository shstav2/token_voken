    "The partial derivatives of a function tell us the instantaneous rate at which the function changes as we hold all but one independent variable constant and allow the remaining independent variable to change.   It is natural to wonder how we can measure the rate at which a function changes in directions other than parallel to a coordinate axes.  In what follows, we investigate this question, and see how the rate of change in any given direction is connected to the rates of change given by the standard partial derivatives.\n",

    "\n",
    "Given a function $z = f(x,y)$, the partial derivative $f_x(x_0,y_0)$ measures the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ as only the $x$ variable changes; likewise, $f_y(x_0,y_0)$ measures the rate of change of $f$ at $(x_0,y_0)$ as only $y$ changes.  Note particularly that $f_x(x_0,y_0)$ is measured in ``units of $f$ per unit of change in $x$,'' and that the units on $f_y(x_0,y_0)$ are similar.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In Preview Activity \\ref{PA:10.6}, we saw how we could measure the rate of change of $f$ in a situation where both $x$ and $y$ were changing; in that activity, however, we found that this rate of change was measured in ``units of $f$ per unit of \\emph{time}.'' In a given unit of time, we may move more than one unit of distance. In fact, in Preview Activity \\ref{PA:10.6}, in each unit increase in time we move a distance of $| \\vv | = 5$ feet. To generalize the notion of partial derivatives to any direction of our choice, we instead want to have a rate of change whose units are ``units of $f$ per unit of distance in the given direction.'' \n",
    "\n",
    "In this light, in order to formally define the derivative in a particular direction of motion, we want to represent the change in $f$ for a given \\emph{unit} change in the direction of motion. We can represent this unit change in direction with a unit vector, say $\\vu = \\langle u_1, u_2 \\rangle$.  If we move a distance $h$ in the direction of $\\vu$ from a fixed point $(x_0,y_0)$, we then arrive at the new point $(x_0+u_1h, y_0+u_2h)$.  It now follows that the slope of the secant line to the curve on the surface through $(x_0,y_0)$ in the direction of $\\vu$ through the points $(x_0,y_0)$ and $(x_0+u_1h, y_0+u_2h)$ is\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ in the direction $\\vu = \\langle u_1, u_2 \\rangle$, we must take the limit of the quantity in Equation~\\eqref{eq:10.6.diff_quot} as $h \\to 0$.  Doing so results in the formal definition of the directional derivative.\n",

    "The quantity $D_{\\vu} f(x,y)$ is called a \\emph{directional derivative}. When we evaluate the directional derivative $D_{\\vu} f(x,y)$ at a point $(x_0, y_0)$, the result $D_{\\vu} f(x_0,y_0)$ tells us the instantaneous rate at which $f$ changes at $(x_0, y_0)$ per unit increase in the direction of the vector $\\vu$. In addition, the quantity $D_{\\vu} f(x_0,y_0)$  tells us the slope of the line tangent to the surface in the direction of $\\vu$ at the point $(x_0,y_0,f(x_0,y_0))$.\n",

    "\n",
    "In a similar way to how we developed shortcut rules for standard derivatives in single variable calculus, and for partial derivatives in multivariable calculus, we can also find a way to evaluate directional derivatives without resorting to the limit definition found in Equation~\\eqref{E:DirDerDef}.  We do so using a very similar approach to our work in Preview Activity~\\ref{PA:10.6}.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we consider the situation where we are interested in the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ at a point $(x_0,y_0)$ in the direction $\\vu = \\langle u_1, u_2 \\rangle$, where $\\vu$ is a unit vector.   The variables $x$ and $y$ are therefore changing according to the parameterization\n",
    "\\[x = a + u_1t \\ \\ \\ \\ \\ \\text{ and } \\ \\ \\ \\ \\  y = b + u_2t.\\]\n",
    "Observe that $\\frac{dx}{dt} = u_1$ and $\\frac{dy}{dt} = u_2$ for all values of $t$.  Since $\\vu$ is a unit vector, it follows that a point moving along this line moves one unit of distance per one unit of time; that is, each single unit of time corresponds to movement of a single unit of distance in that direction.  This observation allows us to use the Chain Rule to calculate the directional derivative, which measures the instantaneous rate of change of $f$ with respect to change in the direction $\\vu$.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, by the Chain Rule, it follows that \n",
    "\\[D_{\\vu}f(x_0,y_0) = f_x(x_0,y_0)\\frac{dx}{dt}\\biggm|_{(x_0,y_0)} + f_y(x_0,y_0)\\frac{dy}{dt}\\biggm|_{(x_0,y_0)} = f_x(x_0,y_0)u_1 + f_y(x_0,y_0)u_2.\\]\n",
